  <h1>Canary in the Coal Mine</h1>

  <p>
    In the shadowed depths of coal mines during the 19th and early 20th centuries, 
    miners depended on a fragile creature to protect them from invisible death: the canary.
  </p>

  <p>
    These small yellow birds, sensitive to toxic gases like carbon monoxide, 
    were brought into the mines in small cages. When the air turned poisonous, 
    the canary would show signs of distress—or perish—before the gas reached lethal levels for the miners.
    Their sacrifice was a warning, a <span class="highlight">silent scream in the dark</span>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, the phrase <strong>“Canary in the Coal Mine”</strong> stands as a powerful metaphor—one that represents 
    those who face danger first, whose suffering is the earliest sign of a greater threat. 
    It is a reminder of the fragile lives that once served to protect others, often without choice, and often without thanks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Behind every whistle of a steam vent and the clink of a pickaxe, there fluttered a tiny life—brighter than the darkness around it— 
    sacrificed in silence.
